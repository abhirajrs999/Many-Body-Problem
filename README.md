# Develop a parallelized simulation system using OpenMP to analyze and present the trajectory of 1,000 balls

## Introduction
Considered 1000 balls in a specified rectangular space and I had to
run 720000 iterations by parallezing the code by OpenMP to show trajectory of particles where attraction of force was
taken into account.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/oxone-999/Coding-Problem-Search-Engine.git

2. Install dependencies:
   Install mayavi and its dependencies

   ```shell
   pip install mayavi
   ```
   
   ```shell
   pip install PyQt5
   ```
   Intall any other library or framework required if you dont have for mayavi, refer its official documentation if error comes
## Usage
- Run main_omp.cpp to make various trajectory files as mentioned in the Trajectory folder
- Trajectory.txt contains inital
